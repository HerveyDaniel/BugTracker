Bugtracker is an issue tracking tool made for educational purposes. I wanted to create something practical and relevant while learning a multitude of new technologies. Most of the important features are complete but this application is still a work in progress since I'd like to add more features when I have the opportunity to do so. With Bugtracker, users will be able to create and work on tickets within their assigned project. They can also see information relating to said tickets and project. The admins have all the functionalities that users do with the addition of being able to create, edit, delete, and assign all entities within the application. Clicking "Demo as admin" on the login page will allow you to test all the features available in the latest iteration of this application. The technologies used in this project are React (with TypeScript), Spring Boot, MySQL, and Docker for running this as a multi-container application.

To run application: Navigate to the Backend directory and use "docker compose --env-file docker-compose.env up -d" command.
